# AR Multiplayer Shooting Game

An AR multiplayer shooting game implemented using Unity, ARKit 2.0 plugin, and UNet. <br />
The goal of the game is for players to try to hit each other by tapping the screen and shooting out fireballs. <br />
One of the players will be the host and other players can join the room, so they will share the same coordinates. <br />
The project is a proof of concept for current AR networking technology. <br />
