# AR Multiplayer Shooting Game

An AR multiplayer shooting game implemented using Unity, ARKit2.0 plugin, and UNet. <br />
One of the players can be the host and other players can join the room so they will share the same coordinates. <br />
The goal of the game is to shoot out fireballs by tapping their screens and try to hit each other. <br />
The project is a proof of concept for current AR networking technology. <br />
